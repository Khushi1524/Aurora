            <p>The bitter cold that often comes with chasing the aurora can be a real deterrent, but what if you could
                see the lights while soaking in a natural hot tub? Enter Fairbanks' Chena Hot Springs Resort, whose
                boulder-enclosed lake offers the opportunity to enjoy a warm soak along with the light show. Fairbanks
                lies directly beneath a band of auroral activity, meaning from August to the end of April the town
                regularly experiences a celestial display of green, yellow, and purple.

                The phenomenon is most frequently seen between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., but the early-to-bed crowd need not
                worry. Chena Hot Springs Resort guests can request a wake-up call when the aurora is spotted in the sky.

            <p>Norway has no shortage of prime vantage points. First and foremost is Svalbard, a string of Arctic
                islands midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. Because the archipelago experiences polar
                night, or perpetual darkness, between mid-November and February, it offers visitors double the
                opportunity to see the lights and is the only inhabited place in the world where you can experience the
                phenomenon during the day. Join a three-hour snowcat safari or brave the cold on a snowmobile tour
                complete with a stop for warm drinks and biscuits.

                Troms√∏ is northern Norway's largest city and is situated in the middle of the auroral oval. The city
                offers visitors a wide variety of tours to choose from during its dark season from late September
                through late March. One fun way to see the auroral display is to ride a cable car up Mount Storsteinen,
                which provides one of the best views of the northern lights in the city. Or, if you prefer to experience
                the magic while sipping Akvavit, slide into a table at the Skybar at Clarion Hotel The Edge.
